Given the exponential expansion of the automotive industry and the corresponding surge in the second-hand car market over the last decade, copious amounts of data have become accessible, providing a rich source for business intelligence. To this end, our investigation concentrates on the Canadian used car dataset to evaluate the efficacy of R and Python programming languages in constructing machine learning (ML) pipelines. Our research seeks to assist practitioners in making informed decisions regarding the optimal language for data processing by assessing the efficiency of each language across all phases of the ML pipeline, including data pre-processing, modeling, and post-processing.
